#' @description Different American Community Survey (ACS) estimates are released
#' at a variety of geographic levels: block groups, tracts, places (cities,
#' towns, and Census Designated Places (CDPs)), etc. Since HRAs are properly
#' defined by blocks and block level estimates are not available, this
#' crosswalk represents a best attempt to create a crosswalk using the largest
#' possible sub-HRA geographies so as to prevent unnecessary inflation in the
#' standard error during calculation of ACS HRA and Region level estimates.
