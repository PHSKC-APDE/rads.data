## Notes
These files are used for cross-walking between different levels of geography. In August 2019, there was an attempt to reduce reduancy and combine files. However, some redudancy continues to exist, so the user will have to examine the files to ensure they are using the file best suited to their needs.  

All but one of the CSVs were originally created from tabs in '[composition of places-HRA.xlsx](https://kc1.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/teams/PHc/datareq/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BB791BD4F-1554-49F9-8E12-29F132764949%7D&file=composition%20of%20places-HRA.xlsx)' on SharePoint. The exception is [geocomp_blk10_kps.csv](https://github.com/PHSKC-APDE/rads.data/blob/main/inst/extdata/spatial_data/geocomp_blk10_kps.csv), which was copied from [PH_APDEStore].[dbo].[geocomp_blk10_kps] on server 51 on 8/19/2019. It was prepared by Mike Smyser and is the most complete set of cross-walks that we have available. 

The complete commit history for these files is visible in GitHub Bash and GitHub Desktop. Unfortunately, GitHub online does not display commits prior to renaming this folder. You can view a synopsis of this commit [online](https://github.com/PHSKC-APDE/reference-data/commit/d86c4ccaa6b02c41e2f06cb485d9efa11cb73ec4). Individual commits can still be viewed online using the commit id from your log.
