\title{ICD-9-CM Clinical Classifications Software Refined (CCSR) Reference Table}
\format{
A data.table with 8 columns:
\itemize{
\item \strong{\code{icdcm_code}:} ICD-9-CM diagnosis code (character)
\item \strong{\code{icdcm}:} ICD-9-CM code description (character)
\item \strong{\code{superlevel}:} APDE-developed superlevel category providing the highest
level of grouping (character)
\item \strong{\code{broad}:} CCSR-aligned broad category (character)
\item \strong{\code{midlevel}:} APDE-developed midlevel category providing intermediate
grouping between broad and detailed levels (character)
\item \strong{\code{detailed}:} CCSR-aligned detailed category (character)
\item \strong{\code{icdcm_version}:} ICD-CM version number (integer, always 9 for this table)
\item \strong{\code{creation_date}:} Date this table was last updated

\description{
A complete reference table of ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes with hierarchical
Clinical Classifications Software Refined (CCSR) categories used by
Public Health – Seattle & King County for analyzing diagnosis patterns in
Comprehensive Hospital Abstract Reporting System (CHARS) data. ICD-9-CM
codes have been mapped to CCSR categories to maximize comparability with
ICD-10-CM data.
}
\details{
The Clinical Classifications Software Refined (CCSR) is a diagnosis and
procedure categorization scheme developed by AHRQ's Healthcare Cost and
Utilization Project (HCUP) for ICD-10-CM codes. To enable temporal comparability,
ICD-9-CM codes (used in CHARS data from 2012-2015) have been mapped to the
same CCSR-aligned 'broad' and 'detailed' categories.

This table includes CCSR-aligned 'broad' and 'detailed' classifications as well as
APDE-developed 'superlevel' and 'midlevel' categorizations. The APDE categories
were developed to provide additional flexibility in grouping diagnoses at
different levels of granularity and to maximize comparability across ICD-9-CM
and ICD-10-CM coding periods.

This dataset is used by \code{\link[rads:chars_icd_ccs]{rads::chars_icd_ccs()}} and
\code{\link[rads:chars_icd_ccs_count]{rads::chars_icd_ccs_count()}} to provide consistent diagnosis classification
across CHARS analyses.

\strong{Note:} This dataset should be refreshed at minimum on an annual basis to
reflect any changes in CCSR definitions or APDE categorizations.
