\description{
A reference table of valid injury mechanism and intent combinations used by
Public Health – Seattle & King County for analyzing injury-related
hospitalizations in Comprehensive Hospital Abstract Reporting System (CHARS)
data. This table is based on the CDC ICD Injury Matrix framework.
}
\details{
The ICD injury matrices are frameworks designed to organize ICD-coded injury
data ('E-codes') into meaningful groupings. The matrices were developed by the
CDC to facilitate national and international comparability in the presentation
of injury statistics.

This table represents the injury definitions currently used by Public Health -
Seattle & King County in their CHARS data ETL process and is based on the latest
available CDC definitions. The table includes all valid combinations of
mechanisms and intents across both ICD-9-CM (2012-2015) and ICD-10-CM (2016+)
coding systems.

\strong{Note:} This dataset should be refreshed at minimum on an annual basis to
reflect any changes in CDC injury matrix definitions.
