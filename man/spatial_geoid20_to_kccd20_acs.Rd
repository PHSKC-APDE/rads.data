\description{
Different American Community Survey (ACS) estimates are released
at a variety of geographic levels: block groups, tracts, places (cities,
towns, and Census Designated Places (CDPs)), etc. This
crosswalk represents a best attempt to create a crosswalk using the largest
possible sub-district geographies so as to prevent unnecessary inflation in the
standard error during calculation of ACS King County Council level estimates.
