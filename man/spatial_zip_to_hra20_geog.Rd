\title{Spatial crosswalk between ZIP codes and 2020 HRAs. There is
one row between each ZIP and HRA that intersects geographically}
\format{
A data.table with 409 rows and 11 variables:

\code{ZIP}: ZIP code,

\code{hra20_id}: HRA numeric id,

\code{s2t_fraction}: Percent of the area in ZIP that is also in hra20_id,

\code{isect_amount}: Number of square survey feet in the intersection of ZIP and hra20_id,

\code{tcoverage_amount}: Area of the hra20_id in any ZIP code,

\code{target_amount}: Total area of the HRA (including areas not covered by ZIPs),

\code{hra_name}: Name of the HRA,

\code{source_id}: ZIP,

\code{target_id}: hra20_id,

\code{method}: method to produce intersections,

\code{creation_date}: Date file created
}
\usage{
spatial_zip_to_hra20_geog
}
\description{
These are based on the fractional overlap approach in \code{\link[spatagg:create_xwalk]{spatagg::create_xwalk()}} and broadly
follow that file structure.

Note: ZIP codes are not completely nested within King County. As such, end users
may want to further process this file to handle edge effects
